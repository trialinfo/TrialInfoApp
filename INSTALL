Install NativeScript into $HOME with:

$ mkdir ~/nativescript
$ cd ~/nativescript
$ npm install nativescript

Then, change here and start this app in preview mode with the tns utility you
have installed into $HOME/nativescript/node_modules/.bin/ above:

$ ns run android --emulator
$ ns run android
$ ns build android

The above will automatically install all npm modules required by this app, but
you can also do that manually with:

$ npm install


The app contains a sqlite database.  The contents of the database can be dumped with:

$ sqlite3 app/scoring.sqlite ".schema" > scoring.sql

The database structure can be recreated from the dump as follows:

$ rm -f app/scoring.sqlite
$ sqlite3 app/scoring.sqlite -init scoring.sql


For testing on Android devices, Developer Options and USB Debugging needs to be
enabled:

* Go to Settings > About phone and tap on the build number seven times.
* In Settings > System > Advanced > Developer options, turn on USB debugging.
* Also in Settings > System > Advanced > Developer options, change the Default
  USB configuration to File transfer / Android Auto.

In German, that is:
* Einstellungen > Übder das Telefon, Build-Nummer
* Einstellungen > System > Erweitert > Entwickleroptionen, USB-Debugging
* Standard-USB-Konfiguration: Dateiübertragung/Android Auto
